The Mahabharata Sanskrit: महाभारतम्, Mahabharatam,  is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. It narrates the struggle between two groups of cousins in the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the <a href="kaurava.html" target="-blank"> Kaurava</a> and the <a href="pandava.html" target="-blank">Pandava</a> princes and their successors.</p> 
<p>Mahabharata is completely real and it did take place. There are numerous archaeological and scientific evidence to prove the occurrence and existence of Mahabharata. ... It has been mentioned in the epic that Mahabharata is an “Itihasa” which means history and thus it means that Mahabharata took place.</p><br/>
