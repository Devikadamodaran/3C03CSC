	<p>Krishna Dvaipayana , better known as Vyasa or Veda Vyasa("the one who classified the Vedas"), was a legendary sage portrayed in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, and regarded by Hindu-tradition as the compiler of that work. As a Shaktyavesha Avatar of Vishnu, he is also regarded by tradition as the arranger of the mantras of the Vedas, as well as the author of the eighteen Puranas and the Brahma Sutras. </p>

Vyasa's birth name is Krishna Dvaipayana, which refers to his dark complexion and birthplace. He is often referred to as "Veda Vyasa" as he is believed to have arranged the single eternal Veda into four parts â€” Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.

The word "Vyasa" refers to "compiler," "arranger," and also means "separation," "division." Other meanings are "split," "differentiate" or "describe." It is also a title, given to "a holy sage or a pious learned man," and applied to "persons distinguished for their writings."

Hindus traditionally hold that Vyasa categorized the primordial single Veda into three canonical collections, and that the fourth one, known as Atharvaveda, was recognized as Veda only very much later. Hence he was called Veda Vyasa, or "Splitter of the Vedas," the splitting being a feat that allowed people to understand the divine knowledge of the Veda.

The Vishnu Purana elaborates on the role of Vyasa in Hindu chronology. The Hindu view of the universe is that of a cyclic phenomenon that comes into existence and dissolves repeatedly. Each kalpa cycle is presided over by a number of Manus, one for each manvantara, and each manvantara has a number of Yuga Cycles, each with four yuga ages of declining virtues. The Dvapara Yuga is the third yuga. The Vishnu Purana  says:</p>

   <p> In every third world age (Dvapara), Vishnu, in the person of Vyasa, in order to promote the good of mankind, divides the Veda, which is properly but one, into many portions. Observing the limited perseverance, energy and application of mortals, he makes the Veda fourfold, to adapt it to their capacities; and the bodily form which he assumes, in order to effect that classification, is known by the name of Veda-Vyasa. Of the different Vyasas in the present Manvantara and the branches which they have taught, you shall have an account. Twenty-eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the great Rishis in the Vaivasvata Manvantara and consequently, eight and twenty Vyasa's have passed away; by whom, in the respective periods, the Veda has been divided into four. The first... distribution was made by Svayambhu (Brahma) himself; in the second, the arranger of the Veda (Vyasa) was Prajapati  (and so on up to twenty-eight).</p><br/>
