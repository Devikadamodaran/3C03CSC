	<p>The Pandavas refers to the five brothers of Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, who are the five acknowledged sons of Pandu and central to the epic of Mahabharata.The Pandavas were born to Pandu and his wives, Kunti and Madri by the boon given to Kunti by Durvasa, that she could have a son by any god whom she respects without having any marital affair. She bore him three sons: Yudhishthira by the god of Dharma, Bhima by Vayu, and Arjuna by Indra.</p>
	<p>The Pandavas The Pandavas were regarded as the sons of the Kuru King Pandu and Kunti, however were fathered by different deities due to Pandu's inability of naturally conceiving children. Pandu could not conceive children due to a curse placed by a rishi. Therefore, the Pandavas were born using a mantra given to Kunti as a boon. Yudhishthira was sired by Yama, the God of dharma and death, Bhima by Vayu, the god of wind and strength, Arjuna by Indra, the god of lighting and king of deities, while Nakula and Sahadeva were fathered by the divine twins Ashvins. In the past, Kunti had given birth to Karna as her first born child fathered by Surya (Sun God). Kunti conceived Karna before her marriage while testing the validity of the boon, and abandoned Karna due to his being born out of wedlock. This created a further rift during the Kurukshetra War, as Karna would later lead the army of the Kauravas against his half-brothers.

Due to a decree issued by their uncle Dhritrashtra, the Pandava brothers were forced into exile. They were driven to a barren land, which they transformed into the magnificent city of Indraprastha. A spiteful Duryodhana invited Yudhishthira to gamble their possessions in a game of dice, which was among the turning points of the epic. Yudhishthira gambled and lost his wealth, kingdom, and possessions due to his gambling, which was also attributed to Shakuni rigging the dice game. Therefore, the Pandavas were sent into exile for thirteen years. After spending twelve years of forest exile, they lived in disguise in the Matsya Kingdom for one year.The Pandavas would amass an army as well as obtain the guidance of Krishna to confront and ultimately defeat the Kauravas. Yudhishthira would then reclaim his status as King of Hastinapur and the Kuru Kingdom. To redeem themselves for their actions during the Kurukshetra War, the Pandavas carried out their final penance by scaling and eventually succumbing in the Himalayas. Yudhishthira, as the sole survivor to reach the summit, witnessed the karmic faiths of all those that passed before him and eventually ascended to the afterlife refers to the five brothers of Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, who are the five acknowledged sons of Pandu and central to the epic of Mahabharata. The Pandavas waged a civil war against their extended family consisting of their cousins Kauravas led by Duryodhana and his brothers, as well as their preceptor and gurus Bhishma and Drona respectively. This conflict was known as the Kurukshetra War. The Pandavas eventually won the war with the death of the Kauravas, albeit at great cost as well as breaking contracts. Historical Records refers Pandu Putra as Rajputra.<p/>
<p>Draupadi, also referred to as Krishnaa, Panchali and Yajnaseni, is the heroine of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. She was the common wife of the five Pandava brothersâ€”Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.She is described to be the most beautiful woman of her time and was prophesied to bring the end of many warriors.

Draupadi and her brother, Dhrishtadyumna, were born from a yajna (fire sacrifice) organized by King Drupada of Panchala. Arjuna won her hand in marriage, but she married the five brothers because of her mother-in-law's misunderstanding. Later, Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya ritual and achieved the status of the emperor, and she became the queen of Indraprastha. She had five sons, one from each Pandava, who were collectively addressed as the Upapandavas.

Once, Duryodhana, the cousin of the Pandavas and the chief of the Kaurava brothers, invited him to play a gambling game in Hastinapur out of envy. After Yudhishthira lost Draupadi in the game, she was humiliated by the Kauravas and abused by Karna. The Kaurava prince Dushasana tried to disrobe her but the divine intervention of the god Krishna saved her honour.

Later, she and her husbands were exiled for 13 years with the last year being incognito. During this time, many men including Jayadratha tried to harass her. For incognito, Draupadi disguised herself as a maid and served Sudeshna, queen of Matsya. Kichaka, the general of the kingdom, who was also the brother of Sudeshna, tried to molest her, but was killed by Bhima. After the Kurukshetra War, her humiliation was avenged, but she lost her father, brothers and her five children. At the end of the epic, Pandavas and Draupadi retired to the Himalayas and walked to heaven. Because of her partiality towards Arjuna, Draupadi was the first one to fall on the way.

Draupadi's story has been an inspiration for various arts and performances. There are many books based on her life. In Hinduism, she is extolled as one of the panchakanya ("five virgins"), archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited. In some parts of the sub-continent, a sect of Draupadi exists, where she is worshipped as a goddess.</p>
